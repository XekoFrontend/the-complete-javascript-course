 * Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
 * BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
 * ---- Test data:
 * ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
 * m tall.
 * ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
 * m tall.
